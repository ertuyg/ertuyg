## 👋 Hi, I'm Ertan Uygan

I'm a solution-oriented software consultant with 25+ years of experience in designing and delivering end-to-end systems — from the initial idea to full production rollout.

Clients come to me with a challenge.  
I return with a complete, working solution.

🔧 **What I do**

I work on long-term, tailor-made software projects across industries like:
- 📦 Warehousing & fulfillment
- 🏥 Healthcare & medical publishing
- 🏗️ Construction & retail operations
- 📚 Academic content & automation

I dive deep into the client's domain, not just the codebase — combining modern cloud-native architecture with hands-on execution.

🧭 **Values**
